This is mock up lading page made as an Assignment for The Odin Project's Foundations course.<br> The project main goal was to apply all the HTML5 and CSS learned on the previous lessons. I was provided with an static image of the page design and had to translate it all to code. I had to use a lot of flexbox!<br> The code is not as neat as I'd like, but I will be improving it soon. My goal was simply to make it all work well on the browser.
As I progress on the course, I intend to add more resources.</p>
